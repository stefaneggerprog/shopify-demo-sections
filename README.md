## 🧹 Shopify Custom Sections by S-DEV

This repository contains a collection of custom Shopify sections designed for flexible use within the Shopify Theme Editor.  
All sections are built for **Online Store 2.0** themes and follow best practices for performance, accessibility, responsiveness, and maintainability.
👉 Note: These sections include inline CSS and JS (where needed) to ensure they work out-of-the-box — no additional files or setup required.
For developers: It is recommended to move styles and scripts into separate files (assets/) for easier maintenance and performance optimization.

### 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1️⃣ Copy the desired `.liquid` section file(s) into your theme’s `/sections/` directory.  
2️⃣ Open your **Shopify Theme Editor**.  
3️⃣ Click **Add section** and select the imported section.  
4️⃣ Configure the section visually using the available settings.

💡 Each section provides its own schema and flexible settings: colors, text sizes, images, layout controls, behavior toggles, and more.
💡 For best maintainability, it is recommended to place any custom JavaScript or CSS in separate .js or .css files within your theme’s assets/ directory, and link or import them in your section code as needed. Avoid inline styles or scripts unless absolutely necessary.
