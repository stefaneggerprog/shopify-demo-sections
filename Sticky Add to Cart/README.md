## üìê Additional Infos & Theme Compatibility

- The sticky bar only appears **after** the original ATC button has been scrolled out of view.
- The Visible initially? setting prevents sticky bar from showing until the main ATC has appeared at least once.
- The sticky section listens for variant:change events and reloads its contents accordingly.
- Works out of the box with most Dawn-based themes. Custom ATC Selector ensures broader compatibility.
- Price & compare price are updated live on variant change.
- Compatible with all themes, but ensure the main add-to-cart button uses `name="add"`. If not, change this selector via section settings
